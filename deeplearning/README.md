Course Web of Math6380n: Deep Learning -- Toward Deeper Understanding

This 3-credit course is inspired by Stanford Stats 385 (stats385.github.io), Theories of Deep Learning, taught by Prof. Dave Donoho, Dr. Hatef Monajemi, and Mr. Vardan Papyan. 
The aim of this course is to provide graduate students who are interested in deep learning a variety of mathematical and theoretical understanding of neural networks 
which are currently available in research, in addition to some preliminary tutorials.  

There is no prerequisite, though mathematical maturity on approximation theory, optimization, and statistics will be helpful. 

There will be no exams, but extensive discussions and projects will be expected.
